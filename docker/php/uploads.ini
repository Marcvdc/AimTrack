; Upload limits for AimTrack (dev/prod)
; Keep in sync with Nginx client_max_body_size (currently 20M).

upload_max_filesize = 20M
post_max_size = 24M
max_file_uploads = 20

; Optional safety: limit very large requests overall
; (memory_limit stays at php.ini-production default unless overridden elsewhere)
